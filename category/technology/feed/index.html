				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Hello there!</p>
<p>As being a Software Engineer in the Auth space for nearly a decade, I have had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of technologies and systems over the years. One of the most important of these is OAuth2, an open standard for authorization that is widely used across the internet.</p>
<p>OAuth2 is a powerful tool that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources, without having to share their login credentials. This is done through the use of &#8220;access tokens,&#8221; which can be issued by the user&#8217;s account provider (such as Google or Facebook) and used by the third-party application to access the user&#8217;s resources.</p>
<p>At its core, OAuth2 is all about giving users control over their data. With OAuth2, users can choose which applications they want to share their data with, and can revoke access at any time. This is a major improvement over the traditional system of sharing login credentials, which can be easily compromised and provides no way for users to control access to their data.</p>
<p>My experience at Microsoft and Amazon has been primarily working with OAuth2 to allow users to secure their applications using Azure AD, Cognito, and other identity stores. In addition to that you&#8217;ll see a B2C application that would leverage the ability to utilize sso between Google or some other identity store that allows for 3rd party authorization. </p>
<p>But OAuth2 is not just for big companies like Amazon or Microsoft, it&#8217;s for any website or app that wants to offer a secure and seamless login experience for their users. It&#8217;s also used by companies that want to provide their users with the ability to share their data with other companies, such as their fitness tracker data with their insurance company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">OAuth2 is a flexible standard that supports several different &#8220;flows,&#8221; or methods for obtaining an access token. Here are a few of the most common OAuth2 flows:</span></p>

<ol>
<li>The &#8220;Authorization Code Flow&#8221; is the most common flow used by web applications. In this flow, the user is redirected to the authorization server, where they are prompted to grant the client application access to their resources. After the user grants access, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client application with an authorization code. The client application can then use this authorization code to request an access token from the authorization server.
</li>
<li>The &#8220;Implicit Flow&#8221; is similar to the Authorization Code Flow, but it is intended for use by client applications that are unable to securely store the authorization code. In this flow, the authorization server returns the access token directly to the client application, rather than an authorization code.
</li>
<li>The &#8220;Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow&#8221; is used when the client application is trusted and the user is able to provide their username and password to the application.
</li>
<li>The &#8220;Client Credentials Flow&#8221; is used when the client application needs to access its own resources, without a user&#8217;s interaction.
</li>
<li>Another flow is the &#8220;Device flow&#8221; which is similar to the Authorization Code Flow but intended for limited input device scenarios.
</li>
<li>The &#8220;Refresh Token Flow&#8221; is used to refresh an expired access token.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that different flows are more or less suitable for different use cases, and it&#8217;s important to choose the right flow based on the requirements of the application and the user experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In summary, OAuth2 is a powerful and flexible standard that allows users to share their resources with third-party applications, while maintaining control over their data.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about OAuth2, I hope this information is valuable for you and your business.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have been modeling my own threaded models recently and have been running into quite a few issues. I have finally found what works and doesn&#8217;t work in order to print screws for 3D printing. This post is meant to help guide new CAD users on How to 3D Model Threads for Screws Using FreeCAD. We will go over the process on how to generate a helix in FreeCAD, generate countersunk thread hole, and generate the screw with threads to fit into the countersunk hole.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently working on FreeCAD v 0.7. Depending on your versioning your mileage may vary. Sometimes my FreeCAD will crash randomly when moving to a different workbench or trying to perform some sort of task, be sure to regularly save when working on something in FreeCAD. that being said, since it&#8217;s free it&#8217;s hard to complain.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p>There are some technical terms to keep in mind when working with screws. Understanding these terms will help to make the process easier as there is a lot going on in a screw.<br />
Below is taken from: <em>&#8211; Taken from <a href="https://www.afi.cc/blog/screw-thread-terminology">https://www.afi.cc/blog/screw-thread-terminology</a></em><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=397&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" srcset="https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=199&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg 199w, https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=397&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg 397w, https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=596&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg 596w, https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=794&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg 794w, https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=993&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg 993w, https://www.afi.cc/hs-fs/hubfs/Screw%20thread-1.jpg?t=1534542566013&amp;width=1191&amp;name=Screw%20thread-1.jpg 1191w" alt="Screw thread-1.jpg" width="397" /><br />
<em>When researching different types of screw threads, you will encounter some basic terms:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Major diameter</strong> – In an external thread like the edges of a screw, major diameter refers to the diameter of the overall shaft, including the height of the raised helix. It can be measured on the crests with a </em>calliper<em> rule or slot gauge.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Minor diameter</strong> – Minor diameter measures the diameter of the “root,” or innermost part of the screw, not including the crests of the helix. For accuracy, this measurement requires specialized equipment.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Effective diameter</strong> – The effective diameter is halfway between the major and minor diameters. In other words, it measures halfway up the helix crest. For accuracy, this measurement also requires specialized equipment.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Pitch</strong> – The pitch is the distance between two identical threads.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Flank</strong> – The flank is the angle at which the helix is raised to form a crest on the thread.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Crest</strong> – The crest is the height at which an external thread is </em>raised,<em> or the depth at which an internal thread is indented. For common applications, screws and bolts are measured at the crests, while nuts are measured at the roots.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the screw terminology, the object that you screw the screw has many different names: Taphole, Bolthole, Nuthole, or ThreadedHole. I will be referring to it as a threaded hole in this post, but just don&#8217;t be surprised if you see a different name for the hole as different people call it different names.</p>
<h1>Creating the ThreadedHole</h1>
<p>When creating the threaded hole, we will need to create two things and then utilize the sweep along functionality in FreeCAD in order to sweep the sketch along the helix. Please remember to keep track of your minor and major diameter as you will need to keep this information in mind when creating the screw later on.</p>
<h2>Generate the Helix for Thread</h2>
<p>First, to create the threading, we will have to create the Helix. To do this, open up FreeCAD and open the part workbench.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/M3DWBix.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now that you have moved to the Part Workbench, You should now see some different items at the top of your window in the toolbar section. Below is what mine looks like, you will want to open the icon that has multiple shapes in it. This icon is highlighted below.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/1rofbZK.png" /><br />
If you do not see this icon or the shapes on the left to it. You may need to enable the solids toolbar, you can do this by right-clicking on the toolbar and rechecking the solids section.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ce4XCwd.png" /><br />
After clicking on the multiple shape icon, it will change your combo view on the left to the tasks panel and show the solid creation panel.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/bFoZDg9.png" /><br />
From there, click on the drop-down menu that says <em>Plane</em>. This will open up to show the many different shapes we can create. Click on the row that says <em>Helix</em>.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/kpGjepa.png" /><br />
After clicking on it, we should now be at the Helix Creation panel.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/WhXwL5q.png" /><br />
From here, we can define the different attributes for the helix we are going to generate. Remembering the terminology of the screw, the pitch will determine how many threads are made per mm, height will determine how high it will be, the radius will be the Pitch Diameter displayed in the picture in the terminology section.<br />
Here I am going to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitch : 2MM</li>
<li>Height : 5MM</li>
<li>Radius : 10MM</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/IGFlv2k.png" /><br />
Then when you press the create button. It will generate the helix in the main panel.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/fQZDRw8.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
We have now successfully generated the helix. This is going to be what we utilize to generate the 3d model. We do this by utilizing a sketch to sweep along the helix.<br />
Now that we have the helix, press the close button to finish and close out of this panel.</p>
<h2>Drawing the Sketch for Thread</h2>
<p>Now that we have generated the helix for the thread, we will need to draw what the thread will look like. We can do this by going to the Part Design workbench now.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/VjLJ9Zr.png" /><br />
Now you should see new tools on your toolbar. Click on the item highlighted below. It&#8217;s the page with the two red shapes on it.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/AGGP6z5.png" /><br />
This will open the sketch panel to draw on an item. From here, click on XZ plane and press the OK Button.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/UZvxtUW.png" /><br />
Now we can start drawing the sketch for the threads. Click on the 4 red dotted icon. If you click on a blank space in the toolbar and then hover your mouse over it, it should open a small little window that says &#8220;Create a polyline in the sketch.&#8221; Note that there is another one next to it for creating B Splines, that is not the one you want to use.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/RvCWQmO.png" /><br />
Now, zoom in on the end of the helix, and draw triangle pointing inwards. Remember that we are creating the thread hole, so this is going to be an inward thread. You don&#8217;t have to be exact as we are going to create constraints for the thread in the next step. Just try to draw the triangle with the helix end in the middle of the triangle.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/qPcHuNT.png" /><br />
Now that we have a rough drawing, we can create constraints to make it exact.<br />
The three things we will want to do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>constrain the angle</li>
<li>constrain two lines to be equal lengths</li>
<li>constrain the distance from the points to the origin</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints are important since it will make the sketch go around the helix evenly across the 3 dimensions.</p>
<h3>Constrain The Angle</h3>
<p>First, for the angle, find the angle constraint in the toolbar.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/n2DaJMg.png" /><br />
From there, we will want to press the angle button, and click the two lines below that have arrows pointing to them. And we will then want to make it a 60 degree angle between the two lines.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/3iSdasb.png" /></p>
<h3>Constrain the Length of Thread</h3>
<p>Now that we have made the angle constraint, we will want to make the equality constraint. The picture below has arrows pointing to the two lines you will want to click on after pressing the equality button. This will make the two lines always equal to each other.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/BPuYKIx.png" /></p>
<h3>Constrain the Distance from Thread to Origin of Helix</h3>
<p>Now that we have added the equality constraint, we will want to constrain the distance the points are from the origin. Below is a picture of the fixed horizontal difference icon tool. Click on it, and then press one of the dots on the triangle and then press the origin dot. This will open up a dialog where you can set the distance the dot is from the origin. Depending on how big you want to make the thread, you will change your numbers accordingly, here I have put in a length of 9mm, for the inner point to the origin.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/vdvfGNt.png" /><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/GQvj79E.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then we will do this for one of the dots on the outer edge. I have set it to 11mm.<br />
Now press close on the left panel, to go back to the main view.<br />
We have created the sketch and the helix now. All that is needed now is to sweep the sketch along the helix to generate the 3d design.</p>
<h2>Generate the 3D Thread using Sketch and Helix</h2>
<p>Go back to the Part workbench that we had originally gone to in the first step when creating the Helix. Now there should be a Utility to Sweep icon.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/gVPMTUi.png" /><br />
Click on the Utility to sweep icon and it will open up a new panel called Sweep. Here we can sweep the sketch along the helix. Click on the sketch under the available profiles column and move it to the selected profiles. Then check the boxes &#8220;Create Solid&#8221; and &#8220;Frenet&#8221;.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/UqTCkge.png" /><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/Oa51icn.png" /><br />
Now that we have the sketch in the selected profiles and the helix in the available profiles, click on both of them and then press sweep path.<br />
We will now have to click on each item in the helix while holding ctrl. You will have to do this one pitch at a time,<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/D4YOkw9.png" /><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/p8FkQk2.png" /><br />
After you have clicked each pitch, click on done on the left. This will not generate the ThreadedHole yet.<br />
Press OK after pressing done.<br />
You should now see a 3 dimensional outer thread for your Screw.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/Vz8ZihK.png" /><br />
Congratulations! Now you should have a ThreadBase that you can screw things into.</p>
<h2>Creating the Screw</h2>
<p>In order to create the Screw part, you will follow the same steps you did to create the Outer Thread. The only difference is that you will want to make the inner thread point the other way when drawing the sketch.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/S5XyT3e.png" /><br />
If you want to make the screw thread match the outer thread, be sure to leave a MM or a half mm of space depending on how accurate your 3d printer is. As 3d printers aren&#8217;t usually that accurate, leaving some space will assure that your screw and threadedhole match properly.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The below picture is an example showing the differences between the sketches. This example is using the same sketch, but when you create a new thread, you will need to create a new sketch.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/RpwbL91.png" /><br />
Then sweep along the helix using the new triangle, and you will then have the thread for your screw.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pqtk4Yx.png" /></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this post we have gone through how to generate a helix, draw sketch, and sweep along the helix using the sketch. We went throught this process for both the Threadedhole and the screw. Hopefully now you should be properly equipped to generate screws and threads for your projects. If you have any questions in regards to this, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to reach out to you as soon as possible.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Every now and then I was having issues with my WordPress on Linux App Service gallery application I had gotten from the Azure Marketplace. My plugins would disappear, my themes would break, and all my pictures would disappear. This article is to help users with issues like this, showing how to fix persistence issues for WordPress on Linux Azure App Services.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Behavior</h2>
<p>The reason that this issue occurs is due to the fact that the files are not persisted on the file system after restarts, moved to another worker, or other web app maintenance that Azure&#8217;s master node deems to be suitable for the web app. This makes it so that once there is maintenance on the web app, the cached data isn&#8217;t moved over properly. The posts are kept because they are stored on a SQL database (from my understanding).</p>
<h2>Navigating to Kudu</h2>
<p>Before configuring the web app to persist data, first you have to make sure that you backup your current WordPress site. This is because the setting you are going to change is going to wipe the web app and remove all WordPress content.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before backing up your site, make sure that you have all the plugins, etc&#8230; installed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to backup your current WordPress site, you&#8217;ll have to open Kudu on the WordPress application.<br />
Kudu is a sort of dashboard to debug and connect to your app service. For more information on Kudu you can take a look at these links :<br />
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/what-is-kudu-with-david-ebbo/">Video on Using Kudu From Microsoft</a><br />
That being said, in order to access application&#8217;s Kudu please navigate to your app service &gt; advanced tools &gt; go.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yor6IWP.png" /><br />
This will bring you to the Kudu dashboard. From there, go to Debug Console &gt; SSH.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/KgZVzJA.png" /></p>
<h2>Backing Up Your App Service</h2>
<p>Now that we are in Kudu&#8217;s SSH console, we can start backing up the app service&#8217;s data. In the SSH Console run the following commands:<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
cd /home/site/wwwroot<br />
apk update<br />
apk add zip<br />
apk add ncftp<br />
zip -r wwwroot.zip .<br />
[/code]<br />
Here we are basically going to the wwwroot for your wordpress site, and zipping up everything on the app service and putting it in the wwwroot directory.<br />
Now that we have created a backup of our WordPress site, we still need to put it into our App Service deployment code. In order to do this, first we will need to get the username, password, and FTP site from the publish profile. To get the publish profile, go to your app service and press &#8220;Get Publish Profile&#8221; in the Azure portal.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/gfNwqMp.png" /><br />
Now go back to the SSH console that you got to through Kudu. Now use the code below, replacing YourUsername and YourFTPURL with your respective information retrieved from the Publish Profile :<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
ncftp -u &#8216;YourUsername\$YourUsername&#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://waws-prod-bay-081.ftp.azurewebsites.windows.net&quot;&gt;ftp://YourFTPUrl &lt;/a&gt;site<br />
[/code]<br />
Enter your password, and then use the commands :<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
cd site/wwwroot<br />
put wwwroot.zip<br />
[/code]<br />
Now you should have successfully backed up your app service.</p>
<h2>Configuring App Service to Persist</h2>
<blockquote><p>Note: Please make sure that you have backed up your app service properly. If you aren&#8217;t sure, please make sure to copy the content on your wordpress blog and back it up. This process is going to wipe your currently deployed app service.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that we have backed up our app service. We will have to configure our App Service to properly cache your data. In order to do this go to your app service&#8217;s app settings and simply configure the websites_enable_app_service_storage from false to true.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/bXYT4OK.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now that we have configured this to true, save it.</p>
<h2>Restoring Your App Service</h2>
<p>This will now wipe your app service. Now when you go to your website now and it shows a default app service page. This is normal.<br />
Reopen your Kudu SSH console, and unzip the file you zipped in the backup stage into your app service.<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
unzip wwwroot.zip<br />
[/code]<br />
You have now restored the App Service and it will look like it used to.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have gone through connecting to Kudu, backing up your app service, configuring your app service for persistence, and restoring your app service. Now your WordPress should be ready to go and your plugins won&#8217;t disappear again. If you have anymore questions feel free to post a comment or to open a support ticket with Azure, one of Microsoft&#8217;s Support Engineers will reach out to you to resolve the issue as soon as possible.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post is a short tutorial on utilizing FreeCAD&#8217;s Image module to trace an image. From there we can extrude the image and turn it into a 3D Model.</p>
<p>In FreeCAD, you can extrude an image by first creating a 2D sketch of the image, and then using that sketch to create a 3D solid. Here&#8217;s a general overview of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open FreeCAD and create a new document.</li>
<li>In the Part Design workbench, select the &#8220;Sketch&#8221; tool from the toolbar.</li>
<li>In the sketch, you can use the &#8220;Import Image&#8221; tool to import the image you want to extrude. Once the image is imported, you can trace over the image with the sketching tools to create a 2D sketch of the image.</li>
<li>Once you have completed the sketch, exit the sketch mode.</li>
<li>Select the sketch you have created and then use the &#8220;Pad&#8221; tool to extrude the sketch and create a 3D solid.</li>
<li>In the &#8220;Pad&#8221; Tool properties, set the value of the &#8220;Length&#8221; to extrude the image to a desired height.</li>
<li>Press OK and your image is now extruded.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the quality of the final 3D model will depend on the accuracy of the 2D sketch. You may need to experiment with the sketching and extrusion settings to get the desired result. Also, FreeCAD is a complex program and depending on the version you are using, the interface or the process may change a bit.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you extrude your image in FreeCAD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post is to help to teach How to Give Permissions for a specific user in Azure Active Directory. This post will assume that your API is already set up properly and you have Global Admin rights to grant the permissions to a specific user. If you are not a global admin for the tenant, you will receive a 400 error saying that you are not authorized to do this. For more information on setting up to utilize the Microsoft Graph API or AAD Graph API please refer to this article: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aaddevsup/2018/05/23/using-postman-to-call-the-microsoft-graph-api-using-authorization-code-flow/">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aaddevsup/2018/05/23/using-postman-to-call-the-microsoft-graph-api-using-authorization-code-flow/</a></p>
<h1>Granting Permissions to a Specific User</h1>
<p>When trying to grant a permission to an individual user you will have to grant a specific OAuth2permisison in the tenant for the user. You can do this by using the OAuth2PermissionGrants endpoint.<br />
The only option right now is to utilize the Azure Active Directory(AAD) Graph API endpoint as the Microsoft Graph API doesn&#8217;t support this feature yet.<br />
First, you will want to create an AAD Application Registration, and to press the grant permissions for the Application Registration. This will create an enterprise application for your AAD Application Registration which you will need later.<br />
Using the AAD Graph API, you will want to make a post request to <em>https://graph.windows.net/$tenant/oauth2PermissionGrants?API-version=1.6</em><br />
Replacing <em>$tenant</em> with your tenant ID.<br />
In the request body, you will need to describe the properties for your new Oauth2PermissionGrant. I&#8217;ve described what you will need in your body below.</p>
<pre>{
"clientId": "This is the objectID of the enterprise application/service principal of the AAD Application Registration. You can find this by going to your enterprise Applications blade and finding the enterprise application you created earlier. The object ID should be there.",
"consentType": "please refer to principalID attribute below for more information on the consent type; we will want to put Principal here to grant permissions to a single user",
"expiryTime": "2027-10-08T19:26:10.0101209 (Insert your expiration time here)",
"principalId": "If consentType is "AllPrincipals", the principal ID value should be null, and this consent will apply to all users in the organization.
If consentType is "Principal" then this property specifies the objectId of the user that granted consent, and applies only to that user.",
"resourceId": " bd8e522d-efb5-447e-a2aa-6f500446f2e1, place the resource ID of the resource you want your user to have access to, here I have placed an o365 exchange online object ID ",
"scope": "(insert your scopes/permissions for the user here)",
"startTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00"
}
</pre>
<p>For more information on the entity: OAuth2Permission Grant please refer to our documentation here: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ad/graph/api/entity-and-complex-type-reference#oauth2permissiongrant-entity">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ad/graph/api/entity-and-complex-type-reference#oauth2permissiongrant-entity</a><br />
The scopes you can use are listed below.<br />
Delegated (work or school account) Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All<br />
Delegated (personal Microsoft account) Not supported.<br />
Application Directory.ReadWrite.All</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>By using the Azure Active Directory Graph API and sending a Post Request to the OAuth2PermissionGrant endpoint we are able to give a single user the proper scopes to access a secured API. I refer to another blog using Postman to get an access token utilizing the Authorization Code Flow in order to access the Microsoft Graph API. Note that the same process to get an access token for the Microsoft Graph API will be used to get an access to the AAD Graph API. The only difference will be to grant the proper permissions to the AAD Graph API instead of the Microsoft Graph API and to set a different resource when requesting the access token. After getting access to the AAD Graph API we construct the Post request to the oauth2permissions grant endpoint in the AAD Graph API creating the service principal for the AAD User so that they can access a secured API based on the object ID of the user using a service principal in AAD.<br />
